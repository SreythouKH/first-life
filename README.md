Hi crush
I don't know why I am so easy to crush on you.
You are not handsome, not genius, not rich, not like me.
But I still crush on you for long time.
Yesterday, I met you under the pine near my dorm.
Oh so glad to saw your face, so cute like a baby's face ever.
Then I wanted to sing a song, which is "ALL I EVER NEED" 
...

This is me. I am a person, but I am also a stranger.
I don't know who I am. I just know that I am a girl.
You know when someone ask me, why you think like this? I cannot answer.
Who is your crush? I also don't know; then I ask they that what is a crush?
When they reply, I can understand, but I don't understand.
Every day I always ask myself what am I thinking right now? Why do I want to do that? Why don't I want?
I am so stress whenever I ask like that. Sometimes I am good, but sometimes I am a sily.
